# 3D-printed elevator button reacher
_3D-printed elevator button reacher for accessibility created with OpenSCAD_

## What is it?

This tool assists a person reach to push buttons, specifically in an elevator. It was written in **OpenSCAD**, **scaled larger** using Ultimaker Cura software, then printed on an **Ultimaker 3**.

<!-- After printing, we added a grip material to the end so it works better on buttons. -->

More information can be found on its [Thingiverse page](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3918660).

## What's in this repo?
